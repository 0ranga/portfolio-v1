          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>Within my master's degree program, I had the opportunity to do an internship with 4 other students. Our goal was to create a brand new website for an organization called <em>For Al Aytaam</em>. I had two roles in the team: UI/UX designer and developper. There were two other designers but I was the only developper.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The team: <br>• 1 - UI/UX designer, developper - me <br>• 2 - Web editor, translator <br>• 3 - Web editor, translator <br>• 4 - UI/UX designer, web editor <br> • 5 - UI designer, translator</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here I will only elaborate on my mission as a UI/UX designer.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>For Al Aytaam</em> is a non profit organization which establishes campaigns to raise money for orphanages all around the world. They usually go themselves on location to check with the people in charge of the orphanage what needs to be done and how much money will be needed.</p>

          <h2>Design challenges</h2>
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>As a UI/UX designer, I was in charge of the information architecture, the home page and the campaign page.</p>
            <p>The organization had an outdated website that wasn't even made by proper professionals. It was made by members of the organization on a site builder. The problem with that website is that it was never updated, it did not contain all the necessary information for potential donors.</p>
            <p style = "font-weight:bold;">It looked unprofessional and did not inspire trust.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the new website, the main goals of the organization were to gather money for their campaigns, have a place to centralize all the information about them and their actions as well as show their transparency and reliability.</p>
            <p>They had a good amount of content and were active on social media so we had something to work on.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="projectelement"><img src="visual/website/foralaytaam/foralaytaam-logowithfont.png" alt="" /><div class="project-img-desc"><p>New secondary logo with type that I made (at the client's request)</p></div></div>

          <div class="project-content">
            <h3>The home page</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The first idea that came to mind was to create a home page with an interactive map and pins (with the form of the logo) to show that the organization is very active. In fact they have helped a lot of orphanages in many countries such as Mexico, Jordan, Guinea, Morocco, Thailand etc.</p>

        <div class="project-content-container">
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>As you can see in the example above, there is also a banner containing the statistics of the organization, that are supposed to change as new campaigns are funded. I noticed that usually the types of help they give are always the same: health kits, school supplies, clothes, food and help in building. Displaying this on the home page can really speak for itself, it gives the visitors concrete numbers about what <em>For Al Aytaam</em> does.</p>
            <p>Also, we all like to see some data and numbers! My team agreed on this one.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="projectelement"><img src="visual/website/foralaytaam/foralaytaam-map.png" alt="" /><div class="project-img-desc"><p>Example of interactive map that could be used on home page</p></div></div>

        <div class="project-content-container">
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>Soon enough, I realized that seeing an interactive map directly on the home page, without any explanation, would not be the best idea for a user, especially a first-time visitor.</p>
            <p>But we thought that this map could be reused somewhere else  on the website to better convey that the organization has helped in a lot of different places. It would also be a simpler way to browse through the campaigns.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is a higher fidelity prototype I made:</p>
          </div>

        <div class="projectelement"><img src="visual/website/foralaytaam/foralaytaam-higherfidelity-home.jpg" alt="" /><div class="project-img-desc"><p>Higher fidelity prototype of the home page</p></div></div>

        <div class="project-content-container">
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>The main intention behind this design is to have a home page giving you an overview of what you can find on this website and at the same time it invites you to consult the other sections of the website.</p>
            <p>The client wanted on their website these different sections: <br>• a campaign page <br>• a testimonial page where we can find testimonials of orphans and orphanage workers <br>• an event page</p>
            <p>Of course this is in addition to the basic pages: "About us" and "Contact us"</p>
            <br>
            <p>The brief description would contain a link redirecting to "About us", the last campaign would redirect to the campaign page and the last testimonial would redirect to the testimonial page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually we decided to drop the event section as they did not plan to do a lot of them and it was useless to have an empty section on the website.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="project-content-container">
          <div class="project-content">
            <h3>The campaign page</h3>
            <br>
            <p>For this page I decided to go for a card design for each campaign and add some sort of gamification with progress bars and once again numbers! This is a simple way to present the information and  it is easily understadable by the users. Just with a glimpse they can see which project are funded and which are currently funding, they can also see which need more money and which don't.</p>
